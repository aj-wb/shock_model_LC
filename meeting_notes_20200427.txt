meeting notes: 20200427

description of our shock input:
S asked B: wants draft today, if possible
B: another big modelling project
	- poverty shared prosperity report
	- high profile report
	- poverty group

K: sent table: hh total income variables.txt
	- these are the entre sectors etc

B: for representation, backend/frontend
	- backend: entre sectors
	- frontend: still probably want Brians sectors
		- needs to work off of the original sectors for relaxation ands simulation steps
B: what we need:
	- maps that links the sectors-- 11 wage sectors, 15(?) entre categories sectors --- can actually regroup sectors
	- need: link between these sectors and the wage sectors
	- need mapping of how this works
	- MEC and other sectors, and how this applies to the wages
	- possible one to many mappings

K: how to you input this into the data
B: load LFS sectoral employment():
	- this is where we need to implement

K: subsector level shocks?
	- B:
		- fraction affected at an individual level is likelihood of losing job
		- column fa can be pulled in on any column

B: now question of uncertainty
	-
	- apply uncertainty on dimensions of kayenats analysis
	- biggest uncerainty in code is probability of central value of job
	-
	- option A:
		- set thresholds/ std dev of some kind
		- question is: whats the right way to include uncertainty on these values
		- best approach for now:
			- stick with what we have
			- creates shutdown at sectoral level
			- give +/- 10% absolute at sectoral level
			- so this is implemented at Brians level

B: ** FOR ME:
	- likelihhood of affected to an income lost
	- me: is there repesentation of demand shock?
		- answer: incorporated into FA
	-  

action item:
	-for monday: do this by individual
	- set up the subsector piece
	- need the table at LFS sectors
		-
