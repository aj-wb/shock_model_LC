meeting notes:
present: K,S

20200420--

GMD-- global monitoring database
household surveys homogenized from different countries

S: big question -->
does 4P cover the right people or do we need another mechanism?

poverty teams are assessing the impact--
need a number on latin america
need rapid results

Discussion:
- K--> 
	- implementing the shock at the sectoral level
	- S: high granularity input and shock input
- model can shock 
	- income--> transformed to assets,
	- and then shock the system as assets
	- and was previously used to look at droughts
- K-->
	- Xubei email
		- question of informal/formal sectors
		- S: what do we do for entrpreneurial income
		- K: right now we are just shocking non-ag wage
			- we should be able to incorporate other incomes into the other sectors


- entrepreneurial income: can be literally any source of income

- wage = any kind of compensation in kind or in cash
	- from FIES report

S--> priority to add informal income to the list

S --> remittances, we can drop income by 10% or so

** how to model the 3rd dimension **
- maybe just implement the third dimension of the 3rd dimension, logic statements for self-employed and government

-- can plug the 400 categories into the model/ as households
-- how to do this?
-- montecarlo should account for this
--

S: next steps:
-- full granularity of 500 sectors
-- 
B: once we decide on structure thats easy
	- hhid/sector/job category, we just need to decide

entrepreneurial income


me: convert 'fa' column to a09_pqkb
	- give more granularity and not go to the sector level

other question:
	- how to re-open *****
	- which population do you keep home, by sector, etc

	- can probably do this as a machine learning approach

	- **or ** select the sector that reduces poverty the most


other thoughts: looking at savings
in the CFS --- looking at savings
can we somehow get information about this
we assume right now one year of savings
*** can we use the CFS to calibrate this number or get a better handle on this?
*** or at least get a distribution of what does exist?
CFS is also a household survey
done by Central Bank

looking at the decile level vs. household 
remittances stress test -- +/- 10 % remittances
