private public other
alpha prob loss
gamma_pub , 

pub/privat/other is the scaling factor 

2 orthogonal layers

individual level vs sectoral level.


individual vs sectoral level.


function that merges fies and LFS
-
- and corrects the weight:
	- make sure to use the weights

want all values in per-capita

-- individual-level = pc
	sums to population
-- household weight = per capita weight/ size household
	sums to household

****FIES -- pcwgt****
fies = household survey

***********
calculating frequency for where individual is working--
	- comes from LFS -- so when scaling sector level probs
		- use the LFS weighting -- pwgt

use LFS merged file direct-- 
-- LFSmerge file


lose job by secotr and type

-- so now how to model?
independent- piece 0-4 scale assuming full social distancing

--
--
ratio of job losses to be constant across sector

-- private, self, family, govt, corp
