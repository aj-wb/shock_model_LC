Goal: migration from dropbox to Github
- better file management,
- more code oversight,
- version control in case of code corruption

coding notes:
- may need to migrate file paths relative to github repo, fix broken paths

step 1: Download necessary software
	1a] Create Github Account
		- (if you do not have one currently). 
		- Please send me your username and associated email

	1b] Github Desktop
		- (if you prefer command line git, that is fine too! Github desktop is accessible and GUI/visually based, convenient for this project or new users)

		- downloadable here:
		-- https://github.com/desktop/desktop

	** for windows** you must also download: git BASH
		- downloadable here:
		-- https://gitforwindows.org/
		- use the regular download link, and it will be included
		- the goal is to get: git BASH 
		-- a BASH shell emulator (terminal based software program) that lets you interface with git file management software. we use it simply to confirm the git-LFS software is properly installed.


	1c] Github LFS (large file transfer)
		- allows us to share and store files larger than 100mb via GitHub
		- will require a little use of commandline/terminal. I can provide direct support if this becomes an issue.

		- download from:
		https://git-lfs.github.com/


		- additional directions and documentation: *** highly recommend ***
		https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage
		

		- in terminal, navigate to download location and run the following command:
		git lfs install


############## SECTION SHOULD only be completed by person creating repository ( B & K, no need)
		- go to the repository you want to install:
		git lfs track "*.csv"
		git lfs track "*.dta"
			- this allows us to ensure all existing and future .csv files are saved to the repository regardless of file size.
		- should be all set up to collaborate
#############

step 2: Request Access and Clone github repo to local.
	1] send patrick your github account username and associated email.
	2] look for an email from Github; follow the link to be "invited as collaborator"
	3] open Github Desktop, click in top-left corner "current repository" --> "Add" --> "Clone Repository" --> psaylor16/covid_phl
		- this will set up your local version of the files. do not close github desktop until complete.

step 3: Get comfortable fetching & pulling, committing & pushing changes
	- Patrick can help explain steps

step 4: good to go!
